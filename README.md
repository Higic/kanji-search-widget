# Kanji search widget
This is a small command line widget that gets all Joyo kanji that have certain number of strokes. Made in Rust

## Usage
`cargo run <stroke-amount>` displays a list of kanji, their meanings and both on- and kun- readings.
If no kanji has the asked stroke amount, the app states that no kanji with that amount of strokes are found
